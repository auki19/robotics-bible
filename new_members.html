        <h3>welcome new members!!!!!</h3>
        <p>
            as i'm sure mr. B has explained to you if you're reading this right now, each year we compete in the worldwide First Tech Challenge competitition. the general idea is that you build a less than 18x18x18in robot that can accomplish certain tasks like moving, grabbing and placing things, or even throwing them depending on the game, which switches up every year. 
            <br><br>
            depending on when you're reading this the game for your year may or may not have already been announced. if not, the easiest way to get an idea of how FTC works is to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsitvZ0JaDc">announcement videos of previous years' challenges</a>. they all follow the same format of a 30 second autonomous period then 2 and a half minutes of driver control. generally as a member of the robotics team you fall into one or more of a few different categories that i'll go over here:

            <h3>construction / mechanics <small><small>ft. OG engineering & design captain Finley Torrens</small></small></h3>

            <h3>programming</h3>
        <p>
            this job is one of the main reasons why i'm creating this website. from my experience reaching out to teams from other schools, the job of programming seems to be one of the biggest bottlenecks in terms of team division of labor. and as a programming captain (as of writing this) i'm here to tell you that it has absolutely no right to be. so many beginners in robotics have an understandable aversion to the idea of learning to program, but it truly isn't as intimidating as it looks.
            <br><br>
            first of all, it's worth noting that Rev control hubs (assuming that's what all you in the future still use) do support a surprisingly functional block-coding language that i recommend you use as a jumping-off point towards understanding how to create an FTC program. you can actually stick with blocks all year if you so choose, although i always encourage learning and Java can be a very useful skill to acquire and practice whether or not you already know it. I won't be going into any detail about blocks as i don't have too much experience with them and they're self-explanatory enough that i feel okay about leaving you all to do that on your own. my main concern is with Java.
            <br><br>
            if you're interested in programming and don't already know Java, that's completely okay. I basically made this entire website for the purposes of teaching you what you need to know to get started with it. the code archive tab at the top of the page contains a basic introduction to programming in Java as well as walkthroughs of both driver-control (called TeleOP in FTC) and Autonomous sample programs. i know it may seem a little scary learning how to program, but i promise you that putting in the work will absolutely pay off, and it isn't as much work as it might seem.
            <br><br>
            if you already know Java, great! aside from some minor adjusting to FTC's ecosystem, it's smooth sailing for you. all i need to say is, please please please do not shoulder all of the programming work yourself. i've made that mistake plently of times and believe me, it's a total lose-lose. it may seem like the better option in the short term to just do everything yourself rather than taking the time to educate your teammates, but by the end of your season you'll end up swamped with menial, repetitive, and basic coding work that consumes too much of your time to allow you to get to the more advanced and exciting stuff. help teach anyone who may be interested or at least encourage them to check out my coding guides.
            <br><br>
            (all of this is written under the assumption there are few if not no programmers at all on the team, which is just generally a problem i've seen throughout many teams i've talked to. if there's a decent amount of you that already know how to code then disregard this)
